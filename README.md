## Unlabeled Data Reinforced Generation

* This repository contains the codes and data for my work "A Semi-Supervised Approach for Low-Resourced Text Generation", you can get the pdf version of this paper at [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00584). This is a work finished at 2017. Therefore, it may be kind of out-of-date for now. But it's an important foundation work of my favorite work [MAST](https://github.com/zhyack/MAST). And the method can be easily extend to any seq2seq tasks. In case you have some interests in it, there will be more details sooner of later.

* I do not have the right to distribute Newsela dataset, please apply it at [Newsela](https://newsela.com/data/).

* The code runs on tensorflow 1.2, python 2.7 .
